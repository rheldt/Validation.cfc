Validation.cfc is a ColdFusion Component that performs server-side form validation. It currently validates for required fields, integers, numeric values, e-mail addresses, URLs, IP addresses, social security numbers, United States and Canadian postal codes, US-style Dates, European-style dates, US telephone numbers, US currency, credit card numbers, and passwords. It also has the capability of managing file uploads and can perform mime-type validation.

I know that Validation.cfc runs under ColdFusion 7-10. It should run on 11, but that hasn’t been confirmed. It also runs on BlueDragon 7 and Railo 3.0+.

See the `docs/Validation.cfc.pdf` for complete documentation.
